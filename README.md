Iemand van Taiyuan (they/them/theirs) grows up in the "reform and open period" of China. They listened to songs by Avril Lavigne, Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, and BoA in middle school. They admired their classmates who went to Beijing to watch the Olympic Games and to Shanghai for the World Expo. They had the idea of going to the big cities and experiencing more.

They went to a university where they resonated with British and American literature in class and exposed themselves to many different cultures after class. After graduation, they joined a big company and lived a routine life. They traveled to countries like Japan and the United States. They believed the world and their lives would get better. Isn’t that what the textbook and life told everyone?

Until that day. The day when COVID-19 was known by everyone. Their community was shut down. They experienced hunger and terror that they thought only belonged in textbooks. They witnessed people die of hunger and lack of timely treatment. They were shocked by the "epic fall of grace" of their favorite city.

Everything changed after that day. Their friends started talking about things that they didn’t agree with. They hesitated about discussing ideas with them. They finally realized that there are things that they cannot change. But they can choose to remember the quotes that influenced them and bring the moments with them.
People can make and send false information. But they can’t change the memory of events that truly happened. The feelings that truly existed.
